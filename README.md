# CCRPOG2-MP

In order to run this, compile and run it using

WINDOWS:
```gcc mp.c && a```
LINUX:
```gcc mp.c && ./a.out```


NOTE: the test.txt file doesn't work for linux for some reason, I suggest just making your own (through the CLI MENU of the program) and then export it. Hope you enjoy this project as much as I did making it.
